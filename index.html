        <h4>THE RAINMAKER EFFECT</h4>
        <p>The Rainmaker Effect is a non-profit entity founded on the premise that
            true success comes from enabling and empowering others to succeed.
            <br><br>We believe that true life success comes from working with others to
            accomplish a greater good. We exercise this belief by helping teams of
            youth and young adult groups accomplish a “greater good” in their communities
            by guiding them through a structured, repeatable process focused on making
            a positive community impact.
            <br><br>They learn about how to start something that is important to them as
            well as learning how to engage and team with others to bring their ideas
            to life. During the process, youth learn how to identify and crystalize
            their purpose, how to team with people and create synergy from other team
            members' diverse purposes, how to use their purpose to guide them in the
            creation of a real-world product, and finally how to document and act on a
            well-defined plan to breathe life into their common purpose.
            <br><br>At the end of a Rainmaker Effect program (typically 12-14 weeks in
            length), youth will have acquired and honed real-world skills that they may
            then employ in a number of ways ... from starting a business, to creating a
            legacy type event, to starting a cause, to seeding a movement. The valuable
            skills and experience attained during a Rainmaker Program empower program
            participants with invaluable life skills that will serve them well throughout
            their lives.
            <br><br>Rainmaker Effect's mission of “empowering and equipping youth and young
            adults with the skills, knowledge and tools to become servant leaders in their
            communities” does not stop there. We couple this purpose with the continuous
            building of an ever-expanding network of mentors who freely share their wisdom
            with mentees. When a Rainmaker Effect program participant comes back into their
            community to help other youth learn what they have learned, the "Rainmaker Circle"
            is completed. Each time a mentee returns to become a mentor, the true Rainmaker
            Effect takes place.
            <br><br>Please help us change the world by getting involved or contact us to see how
            Rainmaker Effect can make an impact in your community!</p>
