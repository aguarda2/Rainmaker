        <h4>THE RAINMAKER EFFECT</h4>
        <p>The Rainmaker Effect is a non-profit entity founded on the premise that true success comes from enabling and empowering others to succeed.</p>
        <p>We believe that true life success comes from working with others to accomplish a greater good. We exercise this belief by helping teams of youth and young adult groups accomplish a “greater good” in their communities by guiding them through a structured, repeatable process focused on making a positive community impact. </p>
        <p>They learn about how to start something that is important to them as well as learning how to engage and team with others to bring their ideas to life. During the process, youth learn how to identify and crystalize their purpose, how to team with people and create synergy from other team members' diverse purposes, how to use their purpose to guide them in the creation of a real-world product, and finally how to document and act on a well-defined plan to breathe life into their common purpose.</p>
        <p>At the end of a Rainmaker Effect program (typically 12-14 weeks in length), youth will have acquired and honed real-world skills that they may then employ in a number of ways ... from starting a business, to creating a legacy type event, to starting a cause, to seeding a movement.  The valuable skills and experience attained during a Rainmaker Program empower program participants with invaluable life skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.</p>
        <p>Rainmaker Effect's mission of “empowering and equipping youth and young adults with the skills, knowledge and tools to become servant leaders in their communities” does not stop there.  We couple this purpose with the continuous building of an ever-expanding network of mentors who freely share their wisdom with mentees.  When a Rainmaker Effect program participant comes back into their community to help other youth learn what they have learned, the "Rainmaker Circle" is completed.  Each time a mentee returns to become a mentor, the true Rainmaker Effect takes place.</p>
        <p>Please help us change the world by getting involved or contact us to see how Rainmaker Effect can make an impact in your community!</p>
